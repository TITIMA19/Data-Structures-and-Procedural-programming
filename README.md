Distinct Elements and Dot Product Project
Overview
This project consists of two main algorithms:

Sum of Distinct Elements: Given two sets of elements, this algorithm calculates the sum of all distinct elements present in either set.
Dot Product and Orthogonality Check: This algorithm computes the dot product of two vectors and checks if they are orthogonal based on the dot product result.
